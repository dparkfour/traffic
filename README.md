# Smart Traffic Optimizer ðŸš¦

This project uses reinforcement learning to optimize traffic light control at a simulated intersection with randomly generated traffic flow.

## Folder Structure
- `sim/` - simulation logic (cars, intersection, queues)
- `env/` - custom Gym environment
- `rl/` - training code (PPO, DQN, etc.)
- `ui/` - frontend/dashboard visualization
- `utils/` - helper functions (data logging, seeding)

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
